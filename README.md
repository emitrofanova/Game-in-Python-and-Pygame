This is a game that I created in the last Part of a "Python Programming MOOC 2022" course.

This Game consists of 3 levels. Each level has 1 robot, 10 coins and at least 1 monster. Level number = amount of monsters. 
Monsters can be on the ground or one level upper. The player can move the robot using the arrow keys from the left edge of 
the screen to the right. And up and down, but not higher than the player needs to jump over the monster. Coins fall from top 
to bottom. If a coin meets a monster on the upper level, the coin will go through it, but if it touches a monster on the 
ground, a player will lose. The player also loses if a coin touches the ground or a robot touches a monster. 
Monsters are static, but appear in random places at the beginning of the level. Coins are non static and also appear in 
random places and at random times when starting a level.
The player must collect as many coins as possible.
At the beginning, the player needs to enter his name and if the player wins or loses, the statistics of the top 10 best players 
will be shown.
